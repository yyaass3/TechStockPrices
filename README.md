In this project, I have analyzed the dataset using python which I have shared its code:
1. at first i have described the dataset, sampled its first 5 rows and have done some data cleaning actions on it.
2. in the next step, I have included Descriptive Statistics analysis to bring better perspective about the dataset.
3. after knowing the basis of the dataset, I analyzed its Probability Distribution, Kurtosis and Skewness to bring clear insights about the price behavior.
4. using the correlation matrix to understand the relationship between different components of the dataset.
5. performing visualization tools like line chart and regression plot.
6. adding domain column to the dataset to analyze the domain of price changes for each day.
